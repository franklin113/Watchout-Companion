# Watchout-Companion
Automatically creates buttons on your Stream Deck for every timeline in your WO project file.

Run the script from the command line with the Production Machine's IP address as an argument. Restart companion and your buttons should appear.

The script currently overwrites the original db file Companion uses to save buttons. If my script corrupts that data somehow, just delete it. Companion will generate a new one.  You could also just backup the file.

C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Companion\DB

There aren't many comments in the code yet and there are some extra files in there. I'll clean this up soon.
